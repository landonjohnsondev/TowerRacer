# Tower Takeover
## Project Background
Tower Takeover is a multiplayer game I made in Unity with a team of 5 people.
The game was the final project of the Game Design and Simulation 2 course.
The project required us to use a Network Engine the professor created.
At the end of the semester, we deployed the Unity project onto a Linux server to allow people to connect and play from different computers.

## How to Play the Game
#### NOTE: These instructions will only work until mid May of 2025 since the server will get taken down then.
Click the green code button, download the ZIP, and extract Game.zip inside the extracted folder. Then open the Game folder in the extracted folder, and open TowerRacer.exe.
Since the game is meant to be played on separate computers for each player, download the build and open the exe on each computer you plan to use.

Once in the game, click the Play Online button on each computer. On one of the computers, type a game name that is at least three characters long and click Create Game to create a room.
On the other computers, wait for a white rectangle on the right side with the room name that was typed and click it.
Once everyone has the ready box checked, the game will start.
